# Utils

Just a little folder with every functions and things that I can think of that I use most of the time, already written and working.

# Exemples

You can find a folder that use every or so functions to show how to use them.

# QNA

- There is no static function for stack, queue and chain? Yes, dynamic are more useful, but I can do it if needed.
